# Web-page-Traffic
The web page traffic project is based on a dataset (traffic.csv) contains web traffic data ("events") from a few different web pages ("links") over a period of 7 days including various categorical dimensions about the geographic origin of that traffic as well as a page's content: isrc.

The project aims at having a better understanding of this traffic, most especially the volume and distribution of events, and to develop ideas how to increase the links' clickrates.
